### Black Jack ###

This program uses a class `Class` to represent a player where each player has a `@name`, `@hand`, and `@score` using `attr_accessor` and `attr_reader`.

The hands are primarily what the program interacts with. 
They're stored as arrays of integers, so appending or the `<<` operator and slicing is most of the data manipulation.
