##### RUBY IS FUN #####

**Requirements to run these programs**

Ruby version==2.4.0


## Console Games ##
Console games are run in a computer's terminal, or shell: a text-based IO tool used
to communicate with the computer's kernel, it can also run scripts such as these!

These console games have been built with the intention of learning and practicing
the basics of Ruby, such as data types and manipulations, control flow logic, and syntax.

**Word Guessing Game**

I'll be honest, I hate the name "hangman", but that's what you may know it as!
This script begins with basic output, briefly explaining the game, and prompts
the user for guesses. The user gets 15 guesses. 

It's pretty easy because there are only 7 words that it will randomly choose from. 

**Black Jack**

Also known as 21, the rules of this game have been simplified a bit, but here's what I "know" if you're unfamiliar:
NOTE: I'M NOT A BLACKJACK PERSON
First of all the suites don't matter. So you have 2-10 which are worth their face-value, and J, Q, K, are each worth 10.
Aces are worth 1 here. 

Your score is the sum of your cards' values. 
If your first two cards are equal 21, congrats winner!
If you go over 21 you bust, automatic loss. 
After that, the goal is to get as close to 21 without busting. 
Highest number under 21 (assuming no one got the initial 21) wins. 

So these are the rules in this program however real BlackJack is quite different
