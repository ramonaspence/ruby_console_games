##### RUBY IS FUN #####

**Requirements to run these programs**

Ruby version==2.4.0


## Console Games ##
Console games are run in a computer's terminal, or shell: a text-based IO tool used
to communicate with the computer's kernel, it can also run scripts such as these!

These console games have been built with the intention of learning and practicing
the basics of Ruby, such as data types and manipulations, control flow logic, and syntax.

**Word Guessing Game**

I'll be honest, I hate the name "hangman", but that's what you may know it as!
This script begins with basic output, briefly explaining the game, and prompts
the user for guesses. The user gets 15 guesses. 

It's pretty easy because there are only 7 words that it will randomly choose from. 

**Poker**
